    },
    {

      "rom": "https://example.com/game2-rom.gbc"
    }
  ]
  ````
 2. Upload the JSON file somewhere (like [github.com](https://github.com))

  ```
  https://gameboy.webvr.link?roms=https://example.github.com/roms.json
  ```

Made after the following comment on Reddit:
> All you have to do now is add an option to change the environment into the back seat of a minivan at night, while your parents drive you and your sibling home and you only have the brief lighting of streetlights to play by.

1. Prepare JSON like before
2. Notice the changed URL (/car) and the game index to autoplay as a URL parameter named "i":
  ```
  https://gameboy.webvr.link/car?roms=https://example.github.com/roms.json&i=3
  ```
